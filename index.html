    <p>
      Making these eggs is not hard at all. You just need to boil the quail eggs
      in advance and after that, it wouldn’t take you more than 10 minutes to
      complete the process. By the way, Kwek-kwek has a big brother named
      “Tokneneng“. The latter are boiled chicken eggs cooked the same way. If
      you are thinking of something special to have for merienda, why don’t you
      try your cooking skills by making some kwek kwek. Make sure to have the
      vinegar dip ready too.
